  <h2>CIS 241 Reflections</h2>
  <P>My experience in Web Development 1 class has been a journey of enlightenment. 
  Throughout the course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of various web development concepts and technologies. 

Learning HTML and CSS has been a highlight of the class, 
as it allowed me to grasp the fundamentals of web design and create visually appealing and functional web pages.
 Understanding the structure and styling of websites opened up a world of possibilities for me to express my creativity and build user-friendly interfaces.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Delving into JavaScript was a game-changer, as it enabled me to implement interactive features and enhance user experience through scripting.
 I was able to create dynamic elements, handle user input, and manipulate data on the client-side.</p>
<br>
<p>The class introduced me to the importance of responsive web design, which is crucial in today's mobile-centric world.
 I learned how to optimize websites for different devices and screen sizes, ensuring that users have a seamless experience regardless of the device they are using.</p>
<br>
<p>Throughout the course, I had the opportunity to work on various projects and assignments that simulated real-world scenarios. 
These practical experiences allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in class and further develop my problem-solving and critical thinking skills.</p>
<br>
<p> One of the <span class="highlight">'Ah ha!'</span> moments in web development occurred when I learned how to use links within the same website and the target attribute in HTML anchor tags.
 Before understanding this, I thought users would leave the website entirely when clicking a link.
 However, after learning about the target attribute, I realized it controls how the link opens.
 By adding 'target="_blank"' to the anchor tag, the link opens in a new tab while keeping my website open in the original tab. 
 This revelation was a turning point that significantly improved my understanding of web development.
 Every lab is an opportunity to gain unique insights and perspectives; 
 in general, each lab the class offers is a chance to experience something new and exciting.</p>
 <br>
<p>Overall, my experience in Web Development 1 has been invaluable.
 It has equipped me with the necessary knowledge and skills to create visually appealing, functional, and user-friendly websites.
 I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from the instructor and collaborate with my classmates.
 This journey has inspired me to continue expanding my knowledge in web development and explore new technologies in my future endeavors.</p>
