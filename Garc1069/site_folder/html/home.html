  <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
  <p>Hello there! My name is Lucila, and I come from the sunny state of Acapulco, Mexico.
     My nickname is Lucy, and that's how I prefer to be called by my friends and family. 
     I have been living in the United States for 25 years now, and I've had the chance to visit some beautiful states like Idaho, Texas, and California.
     Currently, I am a resident of Washington and a student at Edmonds College. I feel fortunate to be studying at this college</p>
	</div>
 <div class="personal-col">
  <h3>My Dream</h3>
  <p>Enrolling at Edmonds College was a turning point in my life, both academically and personally. 
    I was the first in my family to complete high school through the GED diploma program offered in Spanish, which was a huge accomplishment. 
    Completing the program impacted my family and friends by encouraging them to continue their education.
    Although it was a challenging experience, it was gratifying. I am grateful for the college's role in my personal growth.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="personal-col">
  <h3>Future</h3>
  <p>The college has been more than just an educational institution - it has been like a family to me. 
     They have provided me with unwavering support, helping me improve my English language skills and assisting me in pursuing a degree in computer information systems.
      I am grateful for the guidance and encouragement that I have received from the faculty and staff at Edmonds College.</p>
